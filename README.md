 Overview

This project aims to predict the trajectory of a basketball shot using computer vision techniques with OpenCV and polynomial regression. By analyzing video footage of a basketball shot, the program calculates the trajectory of the ball and predicts its potential path towards the hoop.

Features

  - Shot Analysis: Utilizes OpenCV for video processing to detect the basketball and track its movement frame by frame.
  - Polynomial Regression: Implements polynomial regression to fit a curve to the detected trajectory points, enabling the prediction of the shot's path.
  - Visualization: Provides visualization tools to display the detected trajectory and the predicted path, aiding in analysis and interpretation.
  - Accuracy Assessment: Includes methods to assess the accuracy of the prediction against real-world shot outcomes.
